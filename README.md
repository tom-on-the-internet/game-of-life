# Game of Life

This is Conway's Game of Life, written in TypeScript.

This started as a distraction from another side project. I thought I'd try to make Conway's Game of Life, and it turned out to be very easy. I spent a few more hours working other features.

## How

Hit _start_, watch the game play out.

You can stop the game, manually move back and forward. You can also change the delay.

You can reset the game, repopulate or depopulate the board. Draw your own pattern. Share you pattern.
